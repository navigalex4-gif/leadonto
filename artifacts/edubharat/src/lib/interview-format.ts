// Structured interview format — Assessment Scorecard
//
// Mock interviews are conducted and scored against a weighted, nine-parameter
// hiring scorecard modelled on a real BFSI (Banking / Financial Services /
// Insurance) interview assessment form. EVERY parameter is assessed in EVERY
// interview — the interview covers the whole scorecard, not just one area:
//
//   1. Functional Knowledge              25%  — the role-specific core
//   2. Communication Skills              15%  — judged from delivery
//   3. Problem-Solving & Analytical      12%
//   4. Adaptability & Learning Agility   10%
//   5. Ownership & Work Ethic            10%
//   6. Collaboration & Cultural Fit      10%
//   7. Personality & Disposition          8%  — judged from delivery/energy
//   8. Educational Background             5%  — covered by the opening question
//   9. IT Skills                          5%
//
// (weights sum to 1.0). Each parameter is rated 1–5, calibrated to the
// candidate's experience level. Interview LENGTH no longer removes parameters
// from the scorecard — a longer interview simply asks MORE questions (more
// breadth and depth); every parameter is still scored, inferring conservatively
// for any only lightly probed in a short interview.
//
// Communication is scored from HOW the candidate expresses every answer (tone,
// energy, clarity), so it has no dedicated question stage. Personality &
// Disposition is likewise read from delivery, but also gets a warm, one-time
// "getting to know you" opening early on (hobbies, a hobbies follow-up,
// motivation for the role, and strengths / best-fit role) to relax the candidate
// and surface motivation and role fit. Educational Background is covered by the
// opening question. The live question rotation then targets the remaining
// parameters, breadth-first, with Functional Knowledge as the recurring — but
// never dominating — core.
